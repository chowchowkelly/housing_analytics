# Intro

Twin Cities has the *second largest economy* in the Midwest, just behind Chicago. I performed the data analysis on its housing data to help making investment decisions for a hypothetical real-estate investment company. I narrowed the problem down to a few questions that I am able to answer within 4 hours. 

## Goal: maximize investment returns 

## Solution: 
utilize data analytics and past listing price dataset to help:

- deciding which real estate companies to partner with to maximize sales revenue as a home developer
- deciding how much to sell a house for based on sqft
- understanding which property features are more important than others for pricing strategy
- understanding district investment values 
- understanding how district population can affect price


## Findings:
- Re/MAX, Caldwell and Edina Realty occupied 45.36% of the housing market in Twin Cities. They are the ideal companies to partner with for home developers to sell the maximum amount of houses.
- Using linear regression, we predict that it’s reasonable to sell a 2111 square ft house for $302.947
- On predicting listing price, knowing the square footage of the home is more important than knowing the square footage of lot. 
- on deciding investment between Circle Pines and Saint Paul, it will give you greater long-term returns to invest in Saint Paul even though the average listing price is lower than Circle Pines. This is because the nature of Saint Paul has higher demands than Circle Pines. (metropolitan area VS retirement area)
- properties in the industrial area tend to have higher price per capita because the population is relatively much lower than other districts. At the same time, it has lower supply. But it doesn’t imply that industrial area is a good place to invest in buying houses.
